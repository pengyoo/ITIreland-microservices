# IT Ireland: A Twitter-like Social Media Website for IT Practitioners
IT Ireland is a social media platform developed specifically for IT practitioners to foster online communication and collaboration. As a full-stack developer, I successfully contributed to this front-end and back-end separation project, honing my skills and gaining invaluable experience.

## Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Implemented a secure and user-friendly registration and login system using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security. Ensured seamless user experience and robust security measures.
Post Creation: Developed a feature that allows users to create posts, share insights, and engage with the community.
Commenting System: Designed an interactive commenting system, enabling users to add comments to posts and engage in meaningful discussions.
User-Following Functionality: Implemented a follow system to allow users to connect with other IT professionals, stay updated with their posts, and foster a sense of community.
Personalized Feed: Created a tailored feed that displays posts from followed users, providing a streamlined user experience.
Technology Stack:


## Backend:
Leveraged Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Spring Cloud Gateway, Eureka, Spring Cloud Config, AMQP, RabbitMQ, Open Feign), Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, JWT, Amazon S3, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to provide robust and secure microservices services.
## Frontend:
Utilized React.js, Vite, Axios, React Query, and the Mantine component library to develop an intuitive user interface and efficient HTTP requests.
By actively contributing to IT Ireland, I gained hands-on experience in the full software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of web application development, RESTful APIs, and database management.

Overall, IT Ireland is a testament to my ability to deliver scalable and user-centric solutions while collaborating effectively within a development team.
